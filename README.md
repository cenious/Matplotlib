# Observable Trends

Pyber has a presence in urban, suburban and rural areas. The data would suggest that the market share is unequal compared to each region's market. That means that the average fare, number of rides and drivers available will vary by each developed environment.

The correlation between the number of rides and average fare are reflected in the data. Urban cities have the lowest average fares with the highest number of rides. 

Given the data provided, the implication1 is that urban drivers may have more competition and their fares are lower, rural and suburban drivers may have less competition and can charge higher fares. The bubble plot shows (see images file,"PyberRideSharingData.png") that relationship as well as the allocation of drivers per city. The insight that we can gain from this information is that there are cities with a high demand for rides but a disproportionately small number of Pyber drivers to meet demand. It’s suggested that Pyber addresses this imbalance as the ridesharing demand is present, but Pyber’s presence in those cities is not large enough. This will result in more fares collected in revenue as riders will not need to turn to ridesharing competitors or taxi services.

The proposition of increasing drivers in cities with high demand to increase total profits is supported by the data in the pie chart using percentages (see pie chart of "Total Fares by City Type”). While the average fare is smaller in urban cities, the quantity of rides is large enough to account for 62.7% of the total fares.


# My Analysis
We can confirm the total number of rides is proportionately related to the total fares in each region. The drivers who are in Suburban areas have a higher chance to obtain more individual rides than their counterparts in Urban settings, but those drive in rural areas travel long distances with less frequency with the highest average fares in average. An increase in repeat costumers in rural areas with increase their chances as well. 

This does not correlate to pure profit for individual drivers, however, since we do not have the data for average trip length, average cost of gasoline, average miles per gallon each driver has, ect. for new drivers to plan on where they would succeed most. For this reason, I would suggest an increase in exposure to Suburban and Rural areas as they have a higher price per ride, only really missing a higher demand for rides unlike Urban areas.

Urban riders travel shorter distances with more frequency and rural riders travel long distances with less frequency with the highest average fares in average. For that information we would need the ride duration to confirm.
